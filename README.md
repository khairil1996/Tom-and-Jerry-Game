# Tom-and-Jerry-Game
A simple game for kids

I make a Tom and Jerry concept.
I used images in the GUI program.

"src" folder includes all the java files.
"res" folder includes all the image that I used.

How to run the Game:
 1. open the CatGUI.java
 2. run the code with no arguments
 3. enjoy the game!
 
 How to play
 1. You need to run from the dog
 2. Every one of your movement will lead to one movement of the dog
 3. Use the cursor to move the cat
 4. You will lose if the dog catched you.
 5. You also can catch the Rat for extra point.
